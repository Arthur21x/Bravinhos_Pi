252;252;US;Sourced from the estate vineyard—the same vineyard that fuels the Private Stash reserve—this shows a dusty, somewhat charred character, presumably from the barrel aging.

253;253;US;The other realm of the coin from Brown Ranch, Toyon is leaner and lighter, its color even subdued, a study in wild strawberry and layered floral highlights, oak and cardamom spice.

255;255;Italy;This opens with aromas of black plum, oak, espresso, black pepper, balsamic notes and a whiff of barnyard.

256;256;US;The winery's signature widely distributed white is heady in flowery jasmine, with vibrant acidity and a sense of sweetness on the palate thanks to fresh fruit flavors of grapefruit, peach and nectarine.

257;257;US;Smells of rust, iron, tomato and untracked peppercorns rise to the nose. On the palate, the wine is quite light and racy, with a little boysenberry and more sanguine flavors.

263;263;US;Oso Libre ventures into the nonvintage category with this blend of 10 wines from the past five years, delivering a nose with blackberry and a pinch of pepper.

264;264;Italy;Made from vineyards throughout the village of Serralunga d'Alba, this straightforward wine is still closed.

266;266;US;This is a great sunny day wine, starting with aromas of honeydew melon, ripe nectarine and lemongrass.

267;267;US;A brighter, more mineral- and acid-driven take on the often rustic Rhône grape, this kicks off with fresh smells of raspberry and rock. The palate brings tart cherry, followed by just-ripe black berry and really ripe raspberry on the midpalate, and a tartness on the finish.;Anna's Estate Vineyard;88;32.0;California;Paso Robles;Central Coast;Mourvèdre;Adelaida;11.4;0.625;0.66;6.2;0.088;6.0;24.0;0.9988;3.11;0.99;13.3;6;378
268;268;US;There's a lot happening on nose of this wine from Sta. Rita Hills pioneer Richard Sanford's recently rejuvenated Alma Rosa label. Aromas suggest light butterscotch, baked pear, fresh pluot and jasmine. Once sipped, the flavors don't live up to the aromatic promise, but apple, pear and a sharper tangerine rind round out the flavors.;;88;18.0;California;Santa Barbara County;Central Coast;Chardonnay;Alma Rosa;8.3;0.26;0.42;2.0;0.08;11.0;27.0;0.9974;3.21;0.8;9.4;6;380
269;269;Argentina;Immediately this smells raisiny, but with time secondary scents of cinnamon and Middle Eastern spices come into play. The body is soft and extracted, with modest acidity.

274;274;US;The vintage was a great one not only for J's dry table wines but for its sparklers.

276;276;Italy;This wine has more structure and depth than most Pinot Biancos from Alto Adige, thanks to vineyard location and 20% aging in large casks.

277;277;Portugal;Pure Alvarinho from the Monção region, it's rich, creamy and textured. Lined with great acidity, it also has intense apple, bitter orange and a strongly herbal element.

279;279;US;A great follow-up to the winery's 2011, made this time from an esteemed vineyard in one of the coldest parts of the valley.

280;280;Italy;Here's a delicious Soave with depth and character. Floral aromas of Spanish Broom and chamomile take center stage, accented by a smidge of exotic fruit and graphite.

284;284;US;Made from 100% Cabernet, this wine shows the intensity of fruit that Mount Veeder is capable of expressing. It also has excellent acidity.

285;285;US;Right out of the bottle, this 100% Syrah delights for its overall balance and deep, rich array of cherries and blueberries.

289;289;US;Sourced from a 15-acre vineyard on Parrett Mountain, this displays single vineyard specificity.

305;305;New Zealand;Yields were down in 2015, but intensity is up, giving this medium-bodied, silky wine the potential to drink well through at least 2025.

309;309;US;There is a darker fruit spectrum evident in the reserve, with notes of coffee, smoke, black fruits, a touch of charred wood all worked through, and without damping the core fruit flavors.

311;311;Italy;Elegant and savory, this vibrant white offers enticing Spanish broom, yellow stone fruit, wet stone and crushed thyme aromas. The vibrant, ethereal palate carries subtle, tantalizing layers of yellow peach, tangy tangerine, lemon drop and pineapple with lively acidity. A graphite note closes the lingering finish.

315;315;US;From a prime site relatively high in elevation for the appellation, this wine shows beautiful, crisp acidity, as robust layers of mountain raspberry, blackberry and coffee flavor vie for attention.

316;316;US;This pretty, floral wine made entirely from Chardonnay grapes from this site is both creamy and crisp.

317;317;US;Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged. Give it ample aeration, and cranberry, blackberry and black cherry fruits come alive. Dense with fruit and detailed with wet stone minerality, this should be cellared a few years, and consumed from 2020 to 2030.;Ribbon Ridge Estate;94;49.0;Oregon;Ribbon Ridge;Willamette Valley;Pinot Noir;Trisaetum;11.9;0.39;0.69;2.8;0.095;17.0;35.0;0.9994;3.1;0.61;10.8;6;450
318;318;France;The wine comes from the grand showpiece estate of Madiran. A blend that is dominated by Tannat produces a wine that is still so young. Bold fruits and firm tannins are right to the fore, along with acidity and a strong mineral texture. It's a powerful and impressive wine that also manages elegance as well. The wine will take several more years to soften.

319;319;US;The aromas pop, with notes of orange peel, ember, cured meat, black olive and wet stone, with purple fruit lurking in the background.

320;320;France;This is a wine that is beginning to show some fine maturity. There are ripe fruits still very present, but they are matched by the secondary flavors, spice and warm tannins along with the classic herbal character of Mourvèdre. The wine is produced from organically grown grapes, giving purity as well as some serious structure in the background.

321;321;Spain;Spicy yet sweet aromas of sarsaparilla root, saddle leather and earthy berry fruits precede a rich dense palate.

322;322;France;This is one of the classics among Provence rosés. Produced from organically grown grapes and coming from an impressive red-wine producing estate east of Aix-en-Provence, the wine is structured and ageworthy with its blend that includes Cabernet Sauvignon.

323;323;Spain;Ripe pure black-fruit aromas are touched up by notes of malty chocolate and mocha. This is proportionally big, with cheek-grabbing tannins, but it's not overly hard or unbalanced— just the opposite. Flavors of mocha, coffee, hazelnut and ripe berry fruits finish flush, dense and firm, with toasty notes and powerful but controlled residual tannins.

324;324;US;This single-vineyard estate wine is made by Nils Venge and Tom Rinaldi, who have somehow managed to capture quiet elegance and powerful fruit at the same time.

325;325;France;This is an impressively rich, still very young wine. Dominated by Bandol's own Mourvèdre grape, it is dense and concentrated. Spice and dark red fruits are shot through with a wonderful herbal character that conjures the southern warmth. The wine is still just setting out and will not be ready to drink before 2019.;La Bégude;94;44.0;Provence;Bandol;;Provence red blend;Domaine de la Bégude;9.2;0.43;0.52;2.3;0.083;14.0;23.0;0.9976;3.35;0.61;11.3;6;460
326;326;Argentina;Open-grain oak aromas are out front, followed by sweeter scents of marzipan, prune and chocolate. A full, tannic palate is deep and dense, while toasty blackened flavors of cassis and blackberry finish with notes of mocha, chocolate and pepper. This is a bit rough and tannic, so cellaring will help it calm down.

327;327;France;This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity. It is, in its way, an unexpected side of Provence rosé, emphasizing richness and complexity. But it all comes together: a fine wine that, after a year of aging, is ready to drink.;Garrus;94;100.0;Provence;Côtes de Provence;;Rosé;Château d'Esclans;11.5;0.315;0.54;2.1;0.084;5.0;15.0;0.9987;2.98;0.7;9.2;6;464
328;328;France;From old vines in a tree-enclosed vineyard on the third terrace above the River Lot, this wine forms part of a range of wines featuring the soils and terraces of the Cahors vineyard. Named in homage to Marguerite de Massaut, a 16th-century owner of the estate, the wine is aged in new wood that gives it a minty character. That is balanced by the rich black-plum and truffle flavor and the intense acidity. The wine needs to age, so drink from 2021.;Cuvée Marguerite Massaut;94;70.0;Southwest France;Cahors;;Malbec;Château Lagrézette;10.3;0.5;0.42;2.0;0.069;21.0;51.0;0.9982;3.16;0.72;11.5;6;466
329;329;US;Polished in every way, this brings an enticing potpourri of almond paste, apple and white pepper. Wild yeast fermentation in oak (30% new) marries complex components in perfect precise balance. As with all the Ponzi 2014 Chardonnays, the acids are bright but not biting, and the wines are built for both near-term enjoyment and medium-term aging.;Aurora Vineyard;94;63.0;Oregon;Willamette Valley;Willamette Valley;Chardonnay;Ponzi;8.8;0.46;0.45;2.6;0.065;7.0;18.0;0.9947;3.32;0.79;14.0;6;467
330;330;Italy;Scents of woodland berry, rose petal, grilled herb, anisette and a balsamic note emerge on this firmly structured wine. On the robust palate, white pepper, licorice, sage and a hint of toast weave through the black cherry core. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on the close.

331;331;Germany;Juicy, sun-kissed grapefruits and apple blossoms explode from this buoyantly fresh, off-dry Kabinett.

332;332;US;Dense, rich red fruit belies an elegant wine that finds balance despite the concentration of vanilla and berry. Soft, approachable and integrated tannin and oak let the whole exist as one, instead of separate parts. This shows off the appellation's mountain fruit and rocky minerality.;Latro;91;50.0;California;Knights Valley;Sonoma;Cabernet Sauvignon;Galerie;13.0;0.32;0.65;2.6;0.093;15.0;47.0;0.9996;3.05;0.61;10.6;5;470
333;333;Spain;Lightly leesy aromas of vanilla cookie are offset by crisp minerally apple and stone-fruit scents.

334;334;US;From the Lovall Valley section of the Napa Valley quite near Sonoma, this lovely wine is awash in tropical mango, with lilts of pear and vanilla.

335;335;Portugal;The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes. It is huge and powerful, perhaps too much in its concentration, richness and density.

336;336;US;There's a cantaloupe-like ripeness on the nose of this blend of 37% Grenache Blanc, 33% Viognier and 30% Roussanne, but not overdone, layered with seared white peach, caramelized pear, poached apple and almond aromas.

337;337;US;This lush offering opens with appealing aromas of rose petals and fresh strawberries, then glides into a smooth-as-silk midpalate.

338;338;US;A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor.

339;339;Italy;Aromas of slightly stewed fruit, steeped berry, spice and menthol unfold in the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, ground pepper and a mint note while bracing tannins and racy acidity provide the backbone.

345;345;Portugal;This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture.

435;435;US;The nose on this wine from American Idol producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick is a bit reluctant to show itself at first, then lets go of rounded red and purple fruits, with freshly turned soil and dust.

438;438;Italy;Here's a bright, crisp white that delivers aromas of apricot, nectarine, white peach and a whiff of Mediterranean brush that all carry over to the palate.

444;444;Spain;Crisp, minty, herbal aromas of berry and plum lead to a bright, rumbling, tannic palate with energy.

750;750;France;Seduction may be an odd word to use for a Malbec-based wine that is dark and drily tannic. It is structured and firm, with a dry core and black currant fruits.

751;751;Spain;Concentrated aromas of blackened oak, blackberry, cassis, licorice and hickory smoke are clarion calls that this is a fully oaked, modern wine. In the mouth, it's heavy and tannic but doesn't trip over itself. Blackberry, cassis, burnt toast and campfire flavors finish equally toasted, peppery, charred and lemony, with chewy tannins.

752;752;US;With fresh green-apple aromas, and juicy apple and citrus flavors, this is a lively, crisp and well-balanced wine.

753;753;US;Coming from a vineyard near Solvang, this wine by Mikael Sigouin shows orange sponge cake, honey and the slightest twist of petrol on the nose.

754;754;US;Slightly oxidized aromas of marzipan, pressed yellow flowers, dried lemon rinds and apricot cream entice the nose on this wine from the historic vineyard by Joshua Klapper.

756;756;US;Rick Longoria's light winemaking touch even plays into this Spanish grape, which is daintier than regional counterparts. Red and Bing cherries mix with purple flowers, some dried fruit and vanilla paste on the nose. The palate leans herbal, with anise and chopped Italian herbs, also showing brick minerality and oak on the finish.

758;758;US;A black plum-extract character marks the nose of this wine from the folks behind Los Angeles' historic San Antonio Winery, but it's brown spice that dominates, particularly uncrushed cloves and anise seeds.

761;761;US;Full bodied and bold flavored, this is not overwhelmingly dark in color nor pumped up in ripeness. It does emphasize aromas of anise and dried plums, adding flavors of blackberrry juice and a sense of alcoholic strength.

762;762;US;One barrel was new French oak, the other neutral. The cranberry fruit here is subdued and tart, while the barrel aging brings in popcorn, walnuts and even a trace of butter brickle.

765;765;Italy;This blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Petit Verdot offers aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, blue flowers, vineyard dust and dark cooking spices.

767;767;US;Despite the name, this is the value offering, not the reserve, from Soléna. Young, tart and tight, it displays primary fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, with sharp, lemony acids.

768;768;US;Deep purple fruit aromas of dried blackberries and pressed plums benefit from a fresh dill edge as well as a umami element on the nose of this wine from the Rice family, which started making wine in 1990.

771;771;US;The Riesling remains the highlight of this value-oriented lineup, and it's now in a pretty floral package. Bright fruit flavors of orange, tangerine and apricot jam abound, with a clean and fresh mouthfeel.

772;772;US;This is 100% varietal, quite pretty in shades of pale pink, and perfectly dry without turning sour.

773;773;US;Deep blueberry, prune and dried purple aromas are made even more delicious by hints of bacon fat on this blend of 60% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 9% Mourvèdre and 1% Grenache.

774;774;Italy;Aromas of underbrush, black fruit, toast and espresso lead the nose on the blend of Sangiovese and 15% Malvasia Nera.

776;776;Portugal;This is a herbal, earthy wine with as many tannins as fruit at this stage. That gives it a dense, dusty texture that seeps into the ripe, sweet plum flavors. With the wood giving an extra push of richness as well as spice, it needs to age. Drink from 2017.;D.

777;777;Portugal;To judge by the weight of the bottle, this is regarded as an important wine by the producer.

778;778;Chile;Briny aromas of bell pepper, jalapeño and canned pea are green-leaning but not overly vegetal. This has a round mouthfeel and ample body to absorb the wine's acidity, while flavors of celery, bell pepper, lime and tangerine come with a strong grassy accent and a persistent, briny tasting finish.;Justo;89;17.0;Leyda Valley;;;Sauvignon Blanc;Claro;7.4;0.49;0.27;2.1;0.071;14.0;25.0;0.99388;3.35;0.63;12.0;6;1103
779;779;France;This is a blend of Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Viognier (CSV).

780;780;Italy;This opens with aromas of toast, weedy underbrush and tobacco. The palate offers stewed plum marinated in spirits, anisette and coffee but not much fruit richness.

783;783;Italy;Warm and robust, this has aromas of underbrush, spiced plum, grilled sage, leather and a balsamic note.

784;784;US;Though just five years old, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot already seems quite tired, with notes of leather, dried red fruit and mushroom taking the lead.

786;786;France;This wine is all fruit, crisp and with plenty of herbaceousness. A smoother character comes from the Sémillon in the blend that also gives richness.

787;787;France;Produced from young vines, this is the third wine of Larrivet Haut-Brion. As such, it is very accessible with its ripe, red exuberant fruits.

789;789;France;Hugely ripe Merlot is at the core of this rich wine. It is opulent, rounded and packed with dark plum-juice flavors. It verges on too much, too rich and too generous.

792;792;US;Oodles of black cherry and boysenberry fill the aromas and flavors of this bold but not-too-big wine.

795;795;France;The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives a dark fruit character. At this young stage, the wood aging still dominates with its burnt toast and chocolate character.

799;799;US;This wine hails from Lawrence and Antoine Creek vineyards and was barrel-fermented in new French oak before being moved to stainless steel.

804;804;US;This straightforward wine from the Riboli family portfolio goes down very easy, making it perfect for backyard barbecues. Cherries, dried rose petals and anise greet the nose.

805;805;US;There are a lot of varieties in this blend, from Merlot, which makes up the majority, to handfuls of Syrah, Zinfandel and Petit Verdot.

806;806;US;While the nose is delicate with faint hints of yellow plum and pear, the palate is surprisingly brawny and bold.

809;809;France;Although light, this well-balanced wine has good depth. A dry core of tannins backs up the bright red berry and black currant fruits.

812;812;US;Among the well-differentiated single vineyard selections from Soléna in 2014, this may be the most instantly enjoyable.

813;813;US;The oak in this wine is restrained, partly because it aged in stainless steel and a sizable percentage of neutral oak.

815;815;France;Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice.

816;816;France;A soft, stony scent of pebble and the faintest melon signals a fresh, clean wine. The palate plays these aromas out softly but also with precision.

818;818;France;Subtle hints of ripe, winter-stored apple on the nose lead to an equally apple-dominated palate that shows soft pepper spice.

819;819;France;White summer blossoms and ripe green pears make for a fresh scent. The palate lifts these notions with bright lemon acidity. All is buoyed by some residual carbon dioxide.

821;821;US;This is a sophisticated blend of tart yellow fruits with hints of cucumber, salad greens and lemon oil. Though 80% stainless steel fermented, the rest spent time in new oak.

822;822;US;This is a sanguine, full-bodied and nearly jammy wine, rich and plush in black and red fruit and a curious twist of beef jerky.

825;825;Australia;The Dead Arm is always firmly structured, making it one of the more challenging Shiraz to judge in its youth. The 2010 is full-bodied and chewy, characterized by dark, earthy and umami notes of roasted meat, asphalt and grilled mushrooms. The length and ripely tannic nature of the finish is reassuring.

828;828;US;Opulent blackberry aromas and a mouthful of jammy, grapey but dry fruit flavors put a lot of oomph into this focused, concentrated and well-balanced wine.

831;831;US;Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two.

895;895;US;This is the first vintage for this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese. Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins.

969;969;US;Raisin and white pepper aromas, ripe fruit, floral and spicy anise flavors and full body add up to a big wine in which the whole-cluster fermentation method can be tasted.

1119;1119;US;From the vineyard once known as Alisos comes this wine, with aromas of soft clove, red cherry and a touch of sage.

1122;1122;US;Winemakers Mikey Giugni and Michael Brughelli are the first to admit that this is an odd style of wine, but people are digging the pét-nat style.

1125;1125;Germany;Delightfully fun and refreshing, this perlwein, or lightly sparkling white, is Germany's answer to Italian prosecco.

1126;1126;France;This is a tight, fruity wine with high levels of acidity. That is certainly typical of the vintage and brings out very young red currant and berry fruit flavors.

1134;1134;France;Very subtle hints of ripe, red apple hover above the glass. They become more apparent and richer on the slightly spiced palate that also shows hints of pepper and saffron.

1138;1138;US;Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness.
